# RGWBasic

A toy implementation of the *BASIC* programming language inspired in *GW-BASIC*.

```
$ cargo run
...
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 15.22s
     Running `target/debug/rgwbasic`
Ok
10 x = 2    
20 y = 40
30 print x + y
run
42

```

The current implementation is still very limited.
